# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Hugo Polanco

Zinsser's points are for writers to get their thoughts out without using cluttering text. Zinsser uses examples to show this point in simplicity. Writers will use words that "muddy up" sentences and makes it difficult for people to engage in the reading. Instead, he points to using "simplified" terms that are clear. Zinsser talks about clutter and how it is used to hide mistakes or to "inflate" and "make text interesting". Instead, Zinsser wants readers to think about what they want to say. If it's not clear, then there is "clutter" and it needs to be simplified.
